# üåê HTTP vs HTTPS Protocols

## üî∏ What is HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)?

HTTP is a **protocol** used by web browsers and servers to **communicate and transfer data** over the web.

> When you visit a website like `http://example.com`, your browser is using HTTP to request and receive data.

---

## üß™ How HTTP Works (Simplified)
1. You type a URL and hit Enter.
2. Your browser sends an **HTTP Request** to the web server.
3. The server processes it and sends back an **HTTP Response** (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.).
4. The browser displays the web page.

## üîê What is HTTPS (HTTP Secure)?

**HTTPS** = **HTTP + SSL/TLS**

- It adds **encryption and security** to HTTP.
- It uses **SSL/TLS certificates** to secure the connection.
- URLs look like: `https://example.com`

> The **‚ÄúS‚Äù** in HTTPS stands for **Secure**.

|------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Full Form        | HyperText Transfer Protocol      | HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure |
| Security         | Not encrypted                    | Encrypted using SSL/TLS          |
| Port Number      | 80                               | 443                              |
| Use Case         | Non-sensitive websites           | Login pages, payments, APIs      |
