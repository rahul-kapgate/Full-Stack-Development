# üåê How the Web Works (Request ‚Üí Response)

## üß† Overview:
When you visit a website, your browser and the web server **talk to each other** using the **HTTP/HTTPS protocol**. This process is often called the **Request ‚Üí Response cycle**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Process

### 1. **User Enters URL**
- You type `https://example.com` into your browser.

---

### 2. **DNS Lookup**
- The browser contacts the **DNS** to find the IP address of `example.com`.
- DNS returns something like `93.184.216.34`.

---

### 3. **Browser Sends HTTP Request**
- The browser sends a **request** to that IP address:
  ```http
  GET / HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com

### 4. **Server Receives the Request**
The web server (like Apache, Nginx, or Node.js app) receives the request.

It processes the request and decides what to respond with.

---

### 5. **Server Sends HTTP Response**
- The server sends a response back to the browser:

  ```http
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: text/html

  <html>
     <body>Hello, World!</body>
  </html> -->

---

### 6. **Browser Renders the Page**
The browser parses HTML, then loads CSS, JS, images, etc.

It may send more requests for those additional resources.

---

### 7. **User Interacts with the Site**
Actions like clicking a button may trigger more HTTP requests (e.g., via JavaScript or AJAX).

## üß† Summary:
The web works by sending requests from the client (browser) to the server, and getting responses (HTML, CSS, JS, data) in return.
