# 🌍 Domain Name, Hosting, and DNS

## 1. What is a **Domain Name**?

A **Domain Name** is the **human-readable address** of a website.

### Example:
- `google.com`, `facebook.com`, `yourwebsite.dev`

### Without a domain:
You'd have to visit websites using IP addresses like `142.250.190.78` 😵

> **Domain = Easy name to remember a website**

## 2. What is **Hosting**?

**Hosting** is the **service that stores your website's files** (HTML, CSS, images, backend code) and makes them accessible on the Internet.

### Think of it like:
> Your **website's house**. Hosting is the land where your house (website) lives.

### Types of Hosting:
- 🟢 Shared Hosting (cheap, for small sites)
- 🟡 VPS Hosting (more power)
- 🔵 Cloud Hosting (scalable, like AWS, Vercel, Netlify)
- ⚫ Dedicated Hosting (entire server just for you)

## 3. What is **DNS (Domain Name System)?**

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is like the **phonebook of the internet**.

It **translates domain names into IP addresses** so browsers can load the correct website.

### Example:
> You type `www.google.com`  
> DNS says: "Oh, that’s `142.250.190.78`"  
> Your browser connects to that IP.

## 🔗 How They Work Together:

1. You **buy a domain** (like `yourportfolio.com`)
2. You **host** your website on a hosting provider (like Netlify, Vercel, or Hostinger)
3. You **connect the domain to the hosting** using **DNS settings**
4. When someone visits `yourportfolio.com`, DNS resolves it to the hosting server and shows your site!
