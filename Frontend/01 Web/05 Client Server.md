# Client-Server Architecture

## 1. What is a **Client**?
- A **client** is typically a device or application that **requests services or resources** from a server.
- Clients initiate requests for resources or services over a network.
- **Examples**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox), mobile apps, desktop apps.

---

## 2. What is a **Server**?
- A **server** is a **machine or software** that provides services, resources, or data to clients.
- Servers respond to requests made by clients and deliver the requested resources.
- **Examples**: Web server (Apache, Nginx), File server, Database server.

## 3. How Client-Server Communication Works:
- **Client Sends a Request:**
  - The client sends a request over a network (e.g., the internet) to the server using a protocol such as HTTP or HTTPS.
  - **Example**: A browser sends a request to a web server for a webpage.
  
- **Server Processes the Request:**
  - The server processes the incoming request, which may involve querying a database, performing calculations, or accessing files.
  - **Example**: The server may query a database for the requested webpage content.
  
- **Server Sends a Response:**
  - The server sends the requested data or a response back to the client.
  - **Example**: The server sends the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the webpage.
  
- **Client Receives the Response:**
  - The client receives the response, processes it, and displays the result (e.g., a webpage or other data).
  - **Example**: The browser renders the webpage using the data received from the server.

## 4. Types of Servers in Client-Server Architecture:
- **Web Server**: Delivers web pages and services.
- **File Server**: Manages files and allows file access.
- **Database Server**: Handles database queries and returns data.
- **Mail Server**: Manages email exchanges.

---

## 5. Key Characteristics of Client-Server Model:
- **Centralized Control**: The server is the central authority that controls access to resources.
- **Scalability**: Multiple clients can communicate with the same server.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clients handle the presentation layer, while servers handle the data and business logic layer.

## 6. Client-Server Example:
- **Client:** You (a user) open a web browser and type `www.example.com`.
- **Server:** The web server at `example.com` processes your request and sends back the webpageâ€™s HTML, CSS, and images.
- **Client:** Your browser renders the page on your screen.

---

## 7. Client-Server vs. Peer-to-Peer:
- In **client-server** architecture, the server is centralized and clients depend on it for resources.
- In **peer-to-peer (P2P)**, every device can act as both a client and a server, sharing resources with each other.
